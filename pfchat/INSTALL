You have issues?
---------------

- What for a elgg version do you use? This plugin is tested with v1.7
  For older version see [1]. Using later version could be a problem.
- Your webserver requires read and write permission to the mod/pfchat/pfc/data folder.
- Consult http://www.phpfreechat.net/required-config
- Many issues could be solved by clearing the cache. You can do it with following steps
  - Delete all files in mod/pfchat/pfc/data/private except for .htaccess
  - Delete all files in mod/char/pfc/data/public except for the js directory
- Finally you could mail to fstahlberg@gmail.com or visit the project homepage at [1].
